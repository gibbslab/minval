\title{Extract the compartments associated to metabolites of a set of stoichiometric reactions.}
\usage{
compartments(reactionList, uniques = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{reactionList}{A set of stoichiometric reaction with the following characteristics: \itemize{
\item Arrows symbols must be given in the form \code{'=>'} or \code{'<=>'}
\item Inverse arrow symbols \code{'<='} or other types as: \code{'-->'}, \code{'<==>'}, \code{'->'} will not be parsed and will lead to errors.
\item Arrow symbols and plus signs (\code{+}) must be surrounded by a space character
\item Stoichiometric coefficients must be surrounded by a space character and not by parentheses.
\item Each metabolite must have only one stoichiometric coefficient, substituents must be joined to metabolite name by a hyphen (\code{-}) symbol.
\item Exchange reactions have only one metabolite before arrow symbol
\item Compartments must be given between square brackets ([compartment]) joined at the end of metabolite name
}
Some examples of valid stoichiometric reactions are: \itemize{
\item \code{H2O[c] + Urea-1-Carboxylate[c] <=> 2 CO2[c] + 2 NH3[c]}
\item \code{ADP[c] + Phosphoenolpyruvate[c] => ATP[c] + Pyruvate[c]}
\item \code{CO2[c] <=> }
}}

\item{uniques}{A boolean value \code{'TRUE'} or \code{'FALSE'} if uniques must be returned}
}
\value{
A vector with the list of compartments identified for the metabolites of a set of stoichiometric reactions.
}
\description{
For a given set of stoichiometric reactions, this function identifies the compartments
associated to each involved metabolite and return a vector with the list of unique compartments identified.
}
\examples{
# Loading a set of stoichiometric reactions
glycolysis <- read.csv(system.file("extdata/glycolysisModel.csv",package = "minval"), sep='\t')

# Extract unique compartments
compartments(reactionList = glycolysis$REACTION)

# Extract all compartments
compartments(reactionList = glycolysis$REACTION, unique = FALSE)

# Extract compartments of metabolites
compartments(reactionList = "H2O[e]")
